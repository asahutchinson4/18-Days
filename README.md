# 18 Days
 A game where you construct a virus and release it upon the world.

# Overview of Project
I started this project for my foundations of game development course. Our goal was to create a text adventure game similar to the classic ones such as Zork.

# Backstory/Story
You play as a highly specialized scientist that is kidnapped by an unknown person. This anonymous person wants you to construct the perfectly balanced virus in order to control the planet's population. This game allows you to make many decisions that will impact the ending of the game. If you agree to help, you will have 18 days to create a virus that is deadly, contagious and incurable. Each day you can choose one to focus on for the virus. After 18 days have passed and if you choose to release your virus, the virus's statistics will dictate the ending.

# What I Learned
I learned the purpose for coding in this project. I was attempting to hard code all the different branches and paths that the user could go down due to the many choices that they could potentially make. After hours of doing this, I realized how inefficient and time consuming this was. I then used many simple conditional statements to handle all the unique choices the user could make. This saved me from many headaches and from wasting time. I also learned how versatile HTML can be. Not only can it be used in web development, it can be easy to use for a good text adventure game. This was my first introduction to the language and I became quite comfortable with it afterwards.
